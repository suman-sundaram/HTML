<p>Cow's milk is a nutrient-dense liquid from dairy cows,
     vital for human nutrition, providing protein, calcium, 
     vitamins (especially B12 and D), and essential amino acids that support bone health, 
     muscle growth, and overall development. It is a staple in the global diet, 
     used both as a beverage and for making dairy products like yogurt, cheese, and butter.
      While beneficial for many, some individuals experience lactose intolerance or allergies,
     leading to the growing popularity of plant-based alternatives.</p>
